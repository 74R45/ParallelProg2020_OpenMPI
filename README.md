This project is a collection of labs I've done for Parallel Programming 2020 course that are to do with OpenMPI.

## Installation
In order to launch this, you need to install [OpenMPI](https://open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v4.1) and reference it in your project dependencies.

**Warning: `Practical5_2.java` uses an implementation from [mathpar](https://bitbucket.org/mathpar/dap), so you would need to clone that repo in order to use it.**
